# Travel Sphere Online Booking System

## Project Overview
The **Travel Sphere Online Booking System** is a web-based solution designed to modernize the bus reservation process for both local and international routes. This system allows users to book tickets remotely, select seats, make payments, and receive automated booking confirmations and receipts. By eliminating the need for in-person bookings, this system enhances convenience, efficiency, and accessibility for customers while also streamlining operations for bus companies.

## Features
- **Remote Booking**: Allows customers to book bus tickets from anywhere, anytime.
- **Real-Time Seat Availability**: Displays an up-to-date seat map for each bus route.
- **Seat Selection**: Enables customers to choose their preferred seat type (Normal or VIP).
- **Automated Booking Confirmation**: Generates digital receipts with trip details, ticket number, seat number, and payment confirmation.
- **Flexible Booking Management**: Customers can modify or cancel bookings within specified timeframes.
- **Payment Integration**: Supports payments via cash or mobile money (e.g., Mpesa).
- **Reporting**: Generates reports for bus operators on bookings, routes, and revenue.

## Problem Statement
Currently, bus booking systems are often manual, requiring customers to visit physical offices for bookings. This results in long wait times, manual errors in data entry, and limited flexibility for users. The **Travel Sphere Online Booking System** aims to:
- **Reduce operational inefficiencies** and long customer wait times.
- **Improve accessibility** for both local and international customers.
- **Automate data entry** and reduce the risk of errors.
- **Streamline the booking process** with features like real-time seat selection and flexible management.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Payment Integration**: Mobile money API (e.g., Mpesa)
- **Deployment**: Heroku (for web hosting)
